601 Project

Project Topic: Signal Processing

For this term, I would like to do a project based on Signal Processing. I have previously done projects related to image processing where I used blind image deblurring techniques to restore blurred images to sharp images. 
I now want to explore and do a project that is based on audio signal processing or a project that deals with calibrating sensor data to extract useful information. For a project based on audio signal processing, I wanted to implement an application that involves noise removal or music genre classification or speech recognition.
For a project related to real-time signal processing- speech recognition can be one of the real-time implementations. Apart from that, environmental or health monitoring also would be a good implementation for real-time signal processing.
I will soon follow up later in the week with a properly researched plan of action and problem statement for the project based on signal processing and how I plan to implement it. 

Mission: 

Comparing the existing Active Noise Control Systems and implementing Noise Control/ Cancellation


Minimum Viable Product:

An MVP of noise-reduction headphones must include the ANC (Audio Noise Cancellation) circuitry itself which uses destructive interference to reduce noise.
It should also include basics such as a comfortable design which includes a headset which sis usable and should also have the ability to connect to a device.
The MVP should be able to playback audio and must also actively reduce the noise from its environment. 

User Stories:

A noise-cancelling headphone is used by travellers, students, musicians, and workers who work in noisy environments such as construction and manufacturing. 
-A traveller would use noise cancelling headphones to reduce background so that they can listen to music or media when travelling on buses, flights or trains. 

-Students would use these headphones to block out distracting noises while studying. This would help them study in places like libraries or coffee shops without being disturbed.

-Musicians would use noise-cancelling headphones, to record audio better. It is also helpful at concert venues in order to block out the loud noises from the crowd. This would enable them to hear the playback of the music from the band better. 

-Construction Workers or workers that work in environments that are extremely loud can  use noise-cancelling headphones to protect their ears.
