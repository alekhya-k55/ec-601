#601 Project

Project Topic: Signal Processing

For this term, I would like to do a project based on Signal Processing. I have previously done projects related to image processing where I used blind image deblurring techniques to restore blurred images to sharp images. 
I now want to explore and do a project that is based on audio signal processing or a project that deals with calibrating sensor data to extract useful information. For a project based on audio signal processing I wanted to implement an application that involves noise removal or music genre classification or speech recognition.
For a project related to real-time signal processing- speech recognition can be one of the real-time implementations. Apart from that, environmental or health monitoring also would be a good implementation for real-time signal processing.
I will soon follow up later in the week with a properly researched plan of action and problem statement for the project based on signal processing and how I plan to implement it.
